## Welcome to the Contento Next / React Starter Kit

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install all the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
In your Contento Account Settings create a new API Key for this site.

In your Contento CMS starter kit site, in the Content panel:
- Add new Main Nav
- Add new Footer Nav
- Add new General Page

Rename the .env.sample file to .env and copy and paste your unique ID's from Contento into the corresponding secrets. For more information about where to find each ID check out this guide: [https://www.contento.io/developer-resources/starter-kits/ids]

Now run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
